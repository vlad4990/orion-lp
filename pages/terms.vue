              clause 4.5.1 of the Agreement have established in Offer the

              Services are to be carried out in the amount and manner set forth
              in the Offers. Services under the corresponding Offer shall be
              rendered after prepayment receipt only.<br />

              4.5.1 of the Agreement have established in Offer the “Postpay''

              to be carried out as follows:<br />
              4.8.1. The cost of provided Services is determined on the basis of
              the GAMIGIN’ reporting system and is indicated in the invoice
              issued by the GAMIGIN.<br />
              4.8.2. Payment for the cost of Services is made by the Advertiser
              or a third party within NET7, NET15, NET30 or other terms as it
              specified in the Offer. All payments made to the GAMIGIN by any
              third person under the invoices issued under this Agreement shall
              be considered as payments made by the Advertiser.<br />
              Relationships between the Advertiser and any third person not
              regulated by the Agreement are not controlled or verified by the
              GAMIGIN therefore the Advertiser is completely liable for ensuring
              sufficient and lawful basis for conduction of such payments by
              other third persons under the invoices issued under the
              Agreement.<br />4.8.3. Under no circumstances shall the GAMIGIN be
              held financially liable before any third person making payments to
              the GAMIGIN under the invoices issued under this Agreement, in
              particular, but not as a limitation thereof shall the RICHADS not
              be put under obligation to return funds to any third person, or to
              collect interests on the paid funds or other.<br />
              4.8.4. If the Advertiser violates the payment terms stipulated in
              Offer two or more times, the GAMIGIN has the right to unilaterally
              proceed to charging the cost of Services as a prepayment, having
              previously notified the Advertiser by sending a message to the
              сontact email address. All Services which has been ordered by
              Advertiser after the specified moment are executed only after the
              GAMIGIN receives the prepayment. If the Advertiser violates the
              payment terms stipulated in clause Offer of the Agreement and the
              GAMIGIN will incur losses due to this, the Advertiser is obliged
              to compensate for such losses. The prepayment procedure is defined
              in clause 4.7. of the Agreement.<br />
              4.9. Reports. Advertiser may track online reports within GAMIGIN`
              reporting system in Personal Account. The considerations will be
              calculated solely based on the GAMIGIN’ reporting system which
              will track, manage and report in good faith to Advertiser or
              provide Advertiser with an API access to the tracking and
              reporting system at the request of the Advertiser from the
              personal manager ("Reports").<br />4.10. Disputes. In the event
              the Advertiser disputes the information detailed in a Report, it
              will provide the GAMIGIN with a written notice (via e-mail) within
              48 hours from the end of the billing period specified in the
              Agreement (and no later than the 13th day of the month following
              the billing period), which shall include the reasons for such
              dispute with as much detail as possible, in particular, but not
              exclusively, the report with the GAMIGIN’ CLICK ID on which the
              dispute arose, for each conversion CLICK ID it shall be the time
              of completion, the reason for the decline, and the metrics that
              were relied on (“Dispute Notice”). Following receipt of a Dispute
              Notice, the Parties will cooperate, in good faith, to reach an
              amicable solution to such dispute including but not limited
              Advertiser shall provide access to its software and shall provide
              comprehensive assistance for the resolution of controversial
              issues. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties have agreed that
              Dispute Notice about the low quality of traffic without the report
              with the CLICK ID is not considered reasonable and is not
              considered by GAMIGIN. If GAMIGIN provides written proof of the
              quality of the traffic, the dispute is considered closed and the
              quality of the traffic is considered confirmed. The Parties have
              agreed that GAMIGIN` reporting system (stats) will be prevailing
              in any case. At the same time, the Parties acknowledge and
              confirm, that if the quality of the traffic has been confirmed in
              personal correspondence via email or in Personal Account, no
              Dispute Notice about the low quality of traffic will be accepted.
              If the Advertiser misses claim submission deadlines, the Services
              are considered accepted in full without any claims to the quality
              of the traffic.<br />
              4.11. Notwithstanding the foregoing Advertiser must at all times
              and by all means constantly monitor the quality of the traffic it
              receives through the Services offered by GAMIGIN and report
              to/inform GAMIGIN, in writing, about any and all low traffic
              quality within 48 hours since the receipt of such low quality
              traffic. Advertiser understands and agrees that all reported low
              quality traffic will be investigated by GAMIGIN and that only
              GAMIGIN at its own discretion will decide/determine whether such
              traffic is indeed of low quality or not, upon sufficient proof. If
              the Advertiser misses claim submission deadlines, the Services are
              considered accepted in full without any claims to the quality of
              the traffic.<br />
              4.12. GAMIGIN shall not pay in full at least for: a) all
              non-reported low quality traffic, b) all low quality traffic
              reported after the passing of the 48 hours’ time limit, c) all
              reported low quality traffic which according to the GAMIGIN is not
              decided/determined/proved to be of low quality and d) what GAMIGIN
              defines as low quality.<br />
              4.13. Confirmation and Invoicing. On the basis of the GAMIGIN’s
              reporting system data, the Advertiser shall confirm with GAMIGIN
              the amount to be paid for the relevant billing period within 48
              hours from the end of the billing period specified in the
              Agreement (and no later than the 13th day of the month following
              the billing period) via email / Personal Account. If this period
              is missed, then the amount set by GAMIGIN for the relevant billing
              period is considered to be confirmed by the Advertiser in full
              without any claims.<br />
              4.14. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all confirmations, disputes
              or claims under clauses 4.9-4.13 must be submitted and approved no
              later than 48 hours before the payment deadlines set forth in
              Offer. Otherwise, the Services are considered accepted by the
              Advertiser in full without any claims to the traffic quality.<br />
              4.15. Currency. The currency of all settlements between the
              Parties is the US Dollar.

              failure to perform their obligations under the Agreement provided
              such failure resulted from circumstances of extraordinary nature
              that occurred after the Agreement had been concluded. Such
              circumstances of extraordinary nature include exclusively the
              events beyond control of the Party and the Party is not

              with the obligations by the Parties impossible.<br />
              5.2. The Party referring to the circumstances of an extraordinary
              nature shall inform the other Party in writing within 5 days on

              Party’s ability to perform its obligations hereunder, the other
              Party may terminate Agreement for convenience by providing to the
              other Party written notice to such effect.

              clause 7.1 hereof exceeds the minimal<br />
              scale of liability limitation determined by the applicable
              legislation, such minimal scale of liability limitation determined
